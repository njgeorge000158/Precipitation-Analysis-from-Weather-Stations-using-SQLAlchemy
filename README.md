# Climate Analysis in Honolulu, Hawaii - Surfs Up!

In this project, I analyze precipitation data collected by weather stations in Honolulu, Hawaii, using SQLAlchemy Object Relational Model (ORM) queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  You can find the results of the analysis in the IPython notebook, ClimatePy.ipynb.  From the queries, I also created a RESTful Web API using Flask and Python, ClimateApp.py.

The source and module files are in this folder, SurfsUp; the images of plots made in the iPython notebook, ClimatePy.ipynb, are in the Images folder; the logs made by the IPython notebook during testing are in the Logs Folder; and the input CSV and database files are in the Resources folder.
